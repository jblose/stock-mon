## api-key.json

FYI there is a json file that is required that can be encrypted and decrypted via the Makefile as needed. For local development or installation you can create it by hand using the api creation steps on the [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/dashboard) site after creating an account and construct a file named 'api-key.json' that contains:

```json
{
    "api": "<your new api key goes here>"
}
```
